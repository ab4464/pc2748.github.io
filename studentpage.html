Lesson I: Greetings<br><br>

Many people have heard the Italian word for “goodbye,” which is "ciao."  What many non-Italian speakers do not know if that 
“ciao” can mean both “goodbye” and “hello.” You can both greet and wish farewell to someone using the same word, “ciao.” 
To ask a friend how he or she is doing, you would say the following: “Come stai?” However, if you are addressing more than one friend, 
you would say, “Come state?”  The reason the verb changes will be addressed in lesson two.  You can now greet, say goodbye, and 
ask someone how they are doing in Italian.
<br><br>
Lesson II: Verbs<br><br>
In Italian, verbs take on many different forms.  Let us examine the Italian word for "eat."  We will learn many verbs and verb forms in 
future lessons. For example, if you want to say that you are eating, you would say “mangio,” which means both “I” and “eat” 
(I eat).  You would not need to use a subject pronoun.  Here are the forms of the Italian word for eat:
<ul>
<li>Mangio: I eat</li>
<li>Mangi: You eat</li>
<li>Mangia: He, She, It eats</li>
<li>Mangiamo: We eat</li>
<li>Mangiate: You all eat</li>
<li>Mangiano: They eat. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
Lesson III: Verbs and Nouns<br><br>
How would you say, “I eat pizza” in Italian?  In Italian, the noun serving as the direct object normally follows the verb, as it does
in English.  Word order becomes more difficult for English speakers to understand when adjectives are taken into account, but adjectives
will be introduced in another lesson.  The Italian word for pizza is the same in both English and Italian, so you would say, “Mangio
pizza.”  Do you know how to say, “they eat pizza” in Italian?
